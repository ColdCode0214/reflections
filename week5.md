Introduction
---
This website lets you see and understand the relative size of the full range of known objects in our universe,
From the tiniest microcosm to the vast reaches of outer space
including the galaxies and the planets in the universe, as well as the human and the other animals and plants on the earth and
the microbes like bacteria and virus, and even smaller objects like molecule and atom.

You can see the relative sizes of objects arranged on a single scale, 
and grasp the sizes of things that you cannot compare side by side in the real world.


Explanation
---
- The main background is a grid map, which shows the different objects' figure and are moving from the big objects to the small ones.
  You can also change the range of size of the objects by scrolling the mouse
- 由左至右展示了由小至大的objects,在他们的下方有对应的标尺，用于表示它们所对应的尺寸的范围
- 鼠标移动到对应事物上时将出现对象的名称，点击则会切换到该对象的详细界面
You can jump to the page you want by clicking/tapping on the bar that indicates a scale position. 
You can scroll by mouse wheel or swipe the screen left and right with a touch device.
Clicking/tapping the object of your interest will take you to an explanation of the object and its size.
You can see the explanation by clicking/tapping the object or white bar on the bottom of the object.
The object you selected will be displayed together with other objects for size comparison. By clicking/tapping the “Bigger” or “Smaller” Button, you will learn more about the object you selected.
Clicking or tapping the back button will return you to the original page.
Clicking or tapping a unit or title will bring up related explanations about the unit.
- g该图很好的向我们展示了不同物体之间的大小差别，
对于生活中常见的objects，例如兔子、狗、树，我们能很容易的了解它们体型间的大小差距，
但对于行星这种巨大的objects以及细菌这种微小的objects我们很难去感知它们的具体大小
尽管我们可以了解到例如土星的直径这样的数据，但单纯的数字并不能让我们直观地感受到它究竟有多大、究竟比地球大多少。
这张图则利用了对比的方式直观地向我们展示了我们肉眼无法观察的事物的大小关系
